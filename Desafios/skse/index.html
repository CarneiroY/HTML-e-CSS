            <h2>Downloads</h2>
            <p>Current classic build 1.7.3: <a href="">Install via steam</a> - <a href="">Download installer</a> - <a href="">7z archive </a>(<a href="">readme</a>, <a href="">whatsnew</a>)</p>
            <p>Current Anniversary Edition build 2.2.3 (game version 1.6.640): <a href="">Download 7z File</a></p>
            <p>Current GOG Anniversary Edition build 2.2.3 (game version 1.6.659): <a href="">Download 7z File</a></p>
            <p>Current Special Edition build 2.0.20 (game version 1.5.97): <a href="">Download 7z File</a> - you probably want the AE build above unless you know what you are doing</p>
            <p>Current VR build 2.0.12 (game version 1.4.15): <a href="">Download 7z File</a></p>
            <p><strong>If you are using the latest version on Steam, download the AE build.</strong> The older build supporting 1.5.97 is still around to support people who have downgraded their installation or otherwise prevented updates.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Having trouble extracting the archive? Install via Steam, use the installer, or download <a href="">7-zip</a>. <strong>DO NOT USE ANYTHING FROM THE WINDOWS APP STORE.</strong></p>
            <p><a href="">archived builds</a> - <strong>please do not link directly to these</strong></p>
            <p>If you are having trouble with the installation instructions, please <a href="">watch this video.</a></p>
            <p><strong>Compatibility:</strong></p>
            <p>SKSE will support the latest version of Skyrim available on Steam, and <strong>only</strong> this version (currently 1.9.32 with any other numbers following). It is extremely unlikely that any future non-SE Skyrim updates will be released.</p>
            <p>SKSE does not support the Windows Store/Game Pass release of Skyrim. Windows Store applications are locked down similarly to consoles.</p>
            <p>SKSE does not support the Epic Games Store release of Skyrim.</p>

            <h2>Contact the SKSE Team</h2>
            <p>Having crashes on startup after a game patch? Remove the files from Data/SKSE/Plugins and try again. Mods using plugins probably need to be updated. <br>
            Before contacting us, make sure that your game launches properly without SKSE first. <strong>Also, attach skse.log, skse_loader.log, and skse_steam_loader.log (found in My Documents/My Games/Skyrim/SKSE/) to any support requests.</strong></p>
